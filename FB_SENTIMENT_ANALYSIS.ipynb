She lied there, unconscious - unaware of his love; his longing; his devotion. He caressed the loose strand of her hair, that fell the exact way he left her with; he whispered the words of his heart, the one he had treasured since an oblivious eternity; the one he had been longing to enlighten her with. Her divine facial appearance graced his soul; he could stare at her for another eternity and never think either. The love was insane. Not the kind that drive you to fall in love, but the one to just stop and stare, and love the love that oozes from within. They taught love. In all true sense that justifies it's meaning. For they loved; a love that exist just for sake of it. For love. It was not him. Nor her. It was just them and the love.\n",

      "As you grow up, you see the deeper aspects of life; which are - well, perhaps far beyond the emotions we let ourselves overpower with? It's fantastic to have an opinion; a voice. But at times our emotions spread so vast into judging others that they seldom manage to do the same with our own selves. If you love or admire someone, let it be for the sake of just that; and not pulling down what holds no string to it. If you dislike something, let it be for a reason that relates to just you. Spreading the same to others who might as well never know what made you dislike the very thing at the first place - would actually do no help, but intensify the negativity. Our emotions are our greatest strength. But they're too naive to morph in the way they should have. The world is a beautiful place for those who knows the worth of it.\n",

      "The last three years, for me - have been a rigorous process of learning and unlearning things; soft and bitter realisation, positive and trechearous change, some beautiful accomplishments - something I'm extremely proud of, and many add ons that I've put on at different aspects of my narration. Among all these gazillions of instances I come to realize every day, every second - the one that I've thought of taking as a resolution this new year, is choosing to keep and stay around people, who values, who treasures; the one who cherishes my presence. And that, is what I realize I've been doing lately; and that too without any constructive realisation of the same. I surround myself with people who matter to me, the bunch that makes me feel cherished and loved; the family I call mine and rightfully so. I count my blessings and it goes to infinity as I thank the almighty for the family I'm being blessed with. My friends, the precious humans in my life and all of them who've made me feel this overwhelmed to pen my words down - I count all of your existence as a blessing in my life. The people I surround myself with, teach me words of life, world, righteousness, wrong, good, bad - and all that I'll be eternally grateful for. And just as it was rightfully quoted \"I'm the combined effort of everyone I've ever known\" 4 more days to a new year; a new decade (sounds huge lol); I wish all the love, happiness and positivity to the one reading this.\n",

      "He looked at her; his shinning droopy stare as if narrated a story in itself. - a story only she could read. It has been five long years. He smiled at her; And there, she was still in daze, struggling to could come up with a response effective enough. His eyes had the pain. And so had hers. They both could read the untold letters of love in each others; The pain of unloving. She held her child in her arms, while they approached towards each other. Breathe shaky, the air felt too heavy for life. Each step reminded them of the times when they loved; the times when they cherished; the times, they treasured. Every breathe reminded them of a present which wasn't theirs; and a future where they won't love. \"how are you?\" she asked first, her heart felt heavy, heavy for letting it go - the love. Hell did it not hurt. It was ripping her distorted laments, the one she could die to hold back; the one she never wanted to let fall apart. \"good.\" he replied in a voice that terrified his own self. \"What's her name?\" he asked instead, pointing at the little life cuddled up in her arms. The pain was no less. \"Iksha\" she replied. Her lips were tired of faking a smile; her eyes - as if asking for her permission to let go off the tears. His crystal eyeball shone under the setting sun, a few drop of tears lying there in the periphery. \"it's been so long?\" she said next, her voice tearing up. \"it is, actually.\" he replied; the air suffocated him. There was so much; so much of pain that they felt. They spoke so much of life in those few minutes - their eyes being the narrator. If falling in love pains your heart, falling out of love possibly kills your soul. And there, they felt nothing lesser. Their love had pain; So much so that they had to let it go; And, how ironic is that - in the process of letting go off the pain, they ended up loosing their love; a love that they vowed to treasure.\n",

When we're given the power to stand against the wrong, the little tendency to bring out that small portion of the limelight over the head, makes for an good reason to demean and bakcklash someone who's innocent. A certain group of people should not and should never be the reason to shame the entire gender. I've been around men who did nothing but made me feel safe, loved and cherished throughout, men whom I've and I'll look up-to my entire life. How can we overshadow the presence of those precious 'Men' for the small bunch of bustards out there? It's a genuine and ardent request (for the very small number of people reading this), let we, the women, make use of the righteous path, and not demean what we've vowed to treasure.
